When debugging on a emulator, the plugin connects to the emulator process and applies debug operations on the process as requested by the developer. <a href="#emulator-config">-&gt; configure the emulator</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Embedded mode</strong>: Configure the debugger to debug the target application on a physical board (e.g., ESP32). In this mode, the WARDuino VM is deployed on the physical board and runs the target application. The plugin connects to the physical board and applies debug operations issued by the developer. <a href="#board-config">-&gt; configure a physical board</a></p></li></ul><p>When using the embedded mode, the plugin can also switch to <strong>out-of-place mode</strong>. This mode cannot be set through the settings, but is activated during debugging (<a href="#edward">-&gt; EDWARD</a>).</p><h3 id="board-config" tabindex="-1">Configuration for Physical Boards <a class="header-anchor" href="#board-config" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Configuration for Physical Boards {#board-config}&quot;">​</a></h3><p>To enable debugging on the physical board set the <code>Warduino: Debug Mode</code> configuration value to <code>Embedded</code>. This will cause the Plugin extension to configure the WARDuino debugger to target an application running on a board.</p><p>If you opt for the <code>embedded</code> debug mode, additional mandatory and optional configuration values are made available to the developer. The following lists and clarifies such configuration values:</p><ul><li><p><code>Warduino: Port</code> The serial port address for accessing the physical board during debugging. On UNIX-based systems, this address is commonly designated as <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>. Without specifying this port value, the plugin will be unable to establish communication with the physical board, resulting in a plugin initialization failure.</p></li><li><p><code>Warduino: Device</code> this configuration value should be set to the FQBN value of the target board. Currently, WARDuino is only supported on the <em>ESP32</em> MCU and should therefore only be used for boards build on top of the ESP32. To know which FQBN value to use, make sure to first install the desired target board (see the <a href="https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/0.34/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">official Arduino documentation</a>) and then list the FQBN value of the board. With the <code>arduino-cli version 0.34</code> you can list all installed boards along with the appropriate FQBN value by typing <code>arduino-cli board listall</code> in a terminal. For instance, to target the <em>M5StickC</em> board the FQBN value should be set to <code>esp32:esp32:m5stick-c</code>, to target the <em>ESP32 Wrover Module</em> board the value should be set to <code>esp32:esp32:esp32wrover</code>.</p></li><li><p><code>Warduino: Baudrate</code> the baudrate to use with the serial connection to the board. WARDuino supports mainstream baudrate values (i.e., 9600, 115200, 19200) but custom baudrate values are not supported. If a custom baudrate value is needed, feel free to open an issue.</p></li><li><p><code>Warduino: Flash On Start</code> When debugging an application for the first time on a board toggle the <code>flash on start</code> checkbox. This will make sure that the WARDuino VM and the target application (pointed by <code>program</code> entry of the <code>.vscode/launch.json</code> file) is first compiled and flashed into the board. After the flashing completes the plugin then connects automatically to the debugger. In the situation where you aim to debug an application that has already been previously deployed on the board (e.g., through a previous debug session) and is thus being executed by the WARDuino VM. You can uncheck <code>flash on start</code>. This will bypass the default compilation and flashing process. Instead, the plugin will immediately connect to the VM debugger.</p></li><li><p><code>Warduino: WARDuino Tool Chain Path</code> Is the path that points to the WARDuino VM binary code. If you followed the default <a href="/WARDuino/guide/plugin/index.html#installation">plugin installation guide</a>, there is no need to change this value.</p></li><li><p><code>Warduino: WABTool Chain Path</code> Is the path that points to the WABT toolchain version maintained by the TOPLLab. If you followed the default <a href="/WARDuino/guide/plugin/index.html#installation">plugin installation guide</a>, there is no need to change this value.</p></li></ul><h3 id="emulator-config" tabindex="-1">Configuration for an Emulator <a class="header-anchor" href="#emulator-config" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Configuration for an Emulator {#emulator-config}&quot;">​</a></h3><p>To enable debugging on the emulator set the <code>Warduino: Debug Mode</code> configuration value to <code>Embedded</code>. This will cause the Plugin extension to spawn a local WARDuino VM emulator process that runs the target application. Once the local WARDuino VM emulator is spawned, the plugin connects to the VM debugger and applies user-specified debug operations to the process.</p><p>The plugin disregards the other configuration fields as they are only relevant for debugging on a physical board.</p><h2 id="debug-modes" tabindex="-1">Debug Modes <a class="header-anchor" href="#debug-modes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Debug Modes&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="debugging-on-emulators" tabindex="-1">Debugging on Emulators <a class="header-anchor" href="#debugging-on-emulators" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Debugging on Emulators&quot;">​</a></h3><p>When <a href="#emulator-config">configuring WARDuino for debugging on an Emulator</a>, you are opting for remote debugging the target application on a process called an emulator. This emulator, spawned by the plugin, runs the WARDuino VM alongside the target application on the local machine where the plugin also runs.</p><p>An advantage of debugging on an emulator is speed. Each debug operation issued through the plugin is instantely applied to the emulator process resulting in a remarkably fast debugging experience. In contrast, <a href="#board-debugging">remote debugging on a physical board</a> involves debug operations traversing a serial connection, potentially introducing delays specially significant with network-based communication.</p><p>However, a major disadvantage when debugging on an emulator is the absence of the board hardware resources (e.g., pins, LEDs). Therefore, an emulator is primarily useful during the initial debugging stages where the focus is on software correctness rather than the interaction between software and hardware.</p><p>For a comprehensive overview of the available functionality when debugging on a emulator, refer to the <a href="#features">available functionality documentation</a>.</p><h3 id="board-debugging" tabindex="-1">Remote Debugging <a class="header-anchor" href="#board-debugging" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Remote Debugging {#board-debugging}&quot;">​</a></h3><p>When configuring the debugger to <a href="#board-config">target a physical board</a>, the plugin defaults to launching a remote debugger. Consequently, each debug operation is applied on the application running on the Physical board.</p><p>For a comprehensive overview of the available functionality when debugging on a board, refer to the <a href="/WARDuino/reference/plugin.html#features">available functionality documentation</a>.</p><p>Note that while remote debugging on a phyiscal board you can easily switch to <a href="/WARDuino/reference/edward/index.html">EDWARD</a> an event-based-out-place debugger that provides powerful debugging operations. See <a href="#edward">EDWARD</a> on how to start such debugger.</p><h3 id="edward" tabindex="-1">EDWARD: Out-of-place Debugging <a class="header-anchor" href="#edward" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;EDWARD: Out-of-place Debugging {#edward}&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The following introduces how to start EDWARD which is the event-based out-of-place debugger of WARDuino. If you are not yet familiar with event-based out-of-place debugging which is different from remote debugging please consult the introductory page <a href="/WARDuino/reference/edward/index.html">event-based out-of-place debugging documentation</a>.</p><p>To enable EDWARD (Event-based out-of-place Debugger of WARDuino) you have two options:</p><ul><li>Run the <a href="/WARDuino/reference/plugin.html#pull-debug-session">pull debug session command</a>.</li><li>Go to the <a href="/WARDuino/reference/plugin.html#debugging-timeline-view">Debugging Timeline view</a> and click on the <code>save</code> button to extract a debug session from the physical board. Once the whole session has been extracted click then on the <code>debug</code> button to start the EDRWARD debugger on the selected debug session.</li></ul><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1">Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Features&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The following subsections detail the features supported by the plugin.</p><h3 id="mainstream-debug-operations" tabindex="-1">Mainstream debug operations <a class="header-anchor" href="#mainstream-debug-operations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Mainstream debug operations&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Whether using the remote debugger or EDWARD, both provide access to fundamental debug operations accessible through a draggable pop-up interface. The operations include:</p><ul><li><code>pause</code>: pauses the application execution</li><li><code>step</code>: step to the next instruction.</li><li><code>stop</code>: stops the debugger.</li><li><code>step back</code>: shows the previous program location. Note that in case of applying this operation on a physical board. Step back will not undo side-effects but instead will only show the previous state.</li></ul><h3 id="variables-view" tabindex="-1">Variables View <a class="header-anchor" href="#variables-view" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Variables View&quot;">​</a></h3><p>As with other debuggers, you have access to view local and global variables as well as function arguments, all conveniently displayed in the variables view.</p><p>While debugging, the variables view allows you to modify displayed states, but only valid modifications are accepted. For example, changing a variable holding a float number to another float value is permitted. However, attempting to change it to a string will be rejected.</p><p>Regarding the <a href="#mainstream-debug-operations">step back operation</a> and the <a href="#debugging-timeline-view">debugging history view</a>, revisiting previous application states is feasible. Modifying variables within those past states is possible under specific conditions. For further details, refer to the documentation on <a href="#modifying-the-history">modifying the history</a>.</p><h3 id="stack-view" tabindex="-1">Stack View <a class="header-anchor" href="#stack-view" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Stack View&quot;">​</a></h3><p>When debugging at the level of WebAssembly, the stack view will display the current state of the stack. The stack will grow and shrink throughout application execution.</p><h3 id="events-view" tabindex="-1">Events View <a class="header-anchor" href="#events-view" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Events View&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The events view displays the events that can occur while debugging on the target application. These events can be either caused by hardware interrupts (e.g., press of a button) or incoming network messages (e.g., incoming MQTT message) and may arise at any time. As they occur, events are appended at the bottom of the events view.</p><p>The plugin enables the possibility to decide when events get handled by the VM. However, this is (for now) only possible when debugging with EDWARD. To trigger the handling of an event, you can click on the <code>arrow down</code> button <img src="'+i+'" class="inline-icon light"><img src="'+n+'" class="inline-icon dark"> on the right of the <code>Events</code> view name. Once clicked the VM will make sure that the next event in the queue gets handled. This implies that after clicking on the button and advancing the computation with for instance a step debug operation, will cause the program counter to jump to the callback handler of the event.</p><h3 id="proxies-view" tabindex="-1">Proxies View <a class="header-anchor" href="#proxies-view" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Proxies View&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The proxies view is only relevant when debugging with EDWARD which is an event-based out-of-place debugger. To get acquainted with event-based out-of-place debugging technique see <a href="/WARDuino/reference/edward/index.html">documentation</a>. For information on how to start the EDWARD debugger see <a href="#edward">debugging with EDWARD</a>.</p><p>The proxies view displays the primitive functions that are proxied by EDWARD during event-based out-of-place debugging. Developers can selectively stop proxying any of these functions by toggling the checkbox on the left side of the primitive function name. Deactivated functions can be reactivated for proxying by clicking on the toggle box again. During debugging, if a deactivated primitive function is encountered, the VM will execute a default function implementation instead.</p><p>The ability to choose at will which functions to proxy gives more fine-grained control over potential overhead imposed on physical boards. For instance, in the situation where it is crucial to preserve battery life, the developer could opt for proxying only the bare minimal functions.</p><h3 id="debugging-timeline-view" tabindex="-1">Debugging Timeline View <a class="header-anchor" href="#debugging-timeline-view" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Debugging Timeline View&quot;">​</a></h3><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Experimental feature</p><p>The debugging timeline view is currently in an experimental phase and is actively undergoing enhancements. Consequently, certain functionality might not behave as anticipated.</p><p>For example, stepping back to a specific moment when the LED of a physical board was off will not automatically turn the LED off again.</p></div><p>The debugging timeline view provides a comprehensive history of every application state encountered while debugging the target application. Each entry in this view represents a specific application state during the debugging session. Developers can access these entries at their convenience and, under certain conditions, modify them. The following elaborates on these capabilities.</p><h3 id="viewing-the-history" tabindex="-1">Viewing the History <a class="header-anchor" href="#viewing-the-history" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Viewing the History&quot;">​</a></h3><p>To view previous application states, simply click on the eye icon <img src="'+s+'" class="inline-icon dark"><img src="'+r+'" class="inline-icon light"> associated with an entry in the view. Clicking this button prompts the plugin to switch the views to display the application state from that specific point in time.</p><p>Every time that you advance the computation of the target application while debugging (e.g., <code>step</code>, <code>run</code> until breakpoint is reached), a new entry is added at the top of the view. Consequently, the top entry in the view corresponds with the present i.e., the current application state which is valid for your target application. Whereas entries lower than the top entry display the past. The most bottom entry corresponds with the application state that the developer had when the debugger got started.</p><p>Alternatively, another way on how to look at past application states is by pressing the <code>step back</code> button. The availability of the complete debugging timeline aims to provide developers with an overview of the entire history, simplifying the process of navigating to a specific point in time.</p><h3 id="modifying-the-history" tabindex="-1">Modifying the History <a class="header-anchor" href="#modifying-the-history" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Modifying the History&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The capability to modify past states is particularly valuable in exploratory debugging scenarios. For instance, if a developer suspects that a function previously called might fail for specific arguments, revisiting the point before that function call to adjust the arguments would be highly beneficial. However, as noted in the <a href="#variables-view">variables view</a>, altering variable values is restricted to the present. Attempting to modify past variables (e.g., when you are in the present and then you press <code>step back</code> and then try to change a variable) requires an additional step, which we&#39;ll clarify now.</p><p>To enable alterning past application state, developers needs to click on the <code>save</code> button <img src="'+l+'" class="inline-icon light"><img src="'+d+'" class="inline-icon dark"> displayed on the top entry of the debugging timeline. Upon clicking the <code>save</code> button, the plugin preserves the present state. The preserved state can be:</p><ul><li><p>Modified in subsequent debugging phases: For instance, after advancing the application&#39;s execution through one-step debug operation, you can step back and modify the previously saved state. The plugin will automatically deploy the modified state to the target VM (either the physical board or emulator depending on your debugging mode). Debugging then resumes from the adjusted state.</p></li><li><p>Used as the starting point when initiating EDWARD: Once the complete application state is successfully saved, the <code>save</code> button icon transforms into a <code>debug start</code> icon <img src="'+h+'" class="inline-icon light"><img src="'+u+'" class="inline-icon dark">. Clicking this <code>debug start</code> button launches EDWARD to debug starting from that specific saved point in time.</p></li></ul><p>Note that the <code>save</code> button is intentionally available only for the present. Saving the application state is a time-consuming process that may significantly impact battery life when debugging on a physical board. Deciding which points in time to save is a decision best left to the developers.</p><h2 id="vs-code-commands" tabindex="-1">VS Code Commands <a class="header-anchor" href="#vs-code-commands" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;VS Code Commands&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The following details the commands made available by the plugin when you press on <code>cmd+shift+p</code> for OSX and <code>ctrl+shift+p</code> on a Linux-based OS.</p><h3 id="pull-debug-session" tabindex="-1">Pull Debug Session <a class="header-anchor" href="#pull-debug-session" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Pull Debug Session&quot;">​</a></h3><blockquote><p><code>warduino: Pull debugsession</code></p></blockquote><p>During remote debugging on a physical board, you have the option to start EDWARD. For this, you can execute the <code>pull debug session</code> at any point in time during remote debugging. Upon execution of the command, the plugin captures a snapshot from the board and initiates an emulator. This emulator proxies all environment primitive functions from the physical board.</p><h3 id="update-module" tabindex="-1">Update Module <a class="header-anchor" href="#update-module" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Update Module&quot;">​</a></h3><blockquote><p><code>warduino: Update Module</code></p></blockquote><p>The <code>update module</code> command allows you to modify the source code running on the WARDuino VM.
