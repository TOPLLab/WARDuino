  abstract	= {It is extremely hard and time-consuming to make correct
		  and efficient programs for microcontrollers. Usually
		  microcontrollers are programmed in a low level programming
		  language such as C which makes them hard to debug and
		  maintain. To raise the abstraction level, many high level
		  programming languages have provided support for programming
		  microcontrollers. Examples include Python, Lua, C\# and
		  JavaScript. Using these languages has the downside that
		  they are orders of magnitude slower than the low-level
		  languages. Moreover, they often provide no remote debugging
		  support. In this paper we investigate the feasibility of
		  using WebAssembly to program Arduino compatible
		  microcontrollers. Our experiments lead to extending the
		  standard WebAssembly VM with: 1) safe live code updates for
		  functions and data 2) remote debugging support at the VM
		  level 3) programmer configurable (Arduino) modules in order
		  to keep the virtual machine's footprint as small as
		  possible. The resulting WARDuino VM enables the programmer
		  to have better performance than an interpreted approach
		  while simultaneously increasing the ease of development. To
		  evaluate our approach, we implemented a simple breakout
		  game and conducted micro benchmarks which show that the VM
		  runs approximately 5 times faster than Espruino, a popular
		  JavaScript interpreter for the ESP32 microcontroller.},
