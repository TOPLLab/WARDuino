# Examples

This folder contains multiple different example programs for WARDuino.
All WebAssembly text files (.wat) from the examples can be run without additional hardware, by using the emulated version of WARDuino.
This version is packaged as a command line interface.

```bash
./wdcli --file example.wat
```
