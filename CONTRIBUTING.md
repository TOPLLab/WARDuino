# ðŸ’š Contributing to WARDuino

## âœ¨ How Can I Contribute?

If you want to help with development, issues on the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/TOPLLab/projects/1) with low priority are a good starting point.

Any sort of contribution is welcome! Including, but not limited to:

- Report a bug you identified
- Write code which enhances the system or fixes an issue
- PRs that port WARDuino to new platforms, and tutorials to use WARDuino on new boards

## ðŸŽ¨ Style Guide

### Commit Messages

- Capitalize the first line and each paragraph
- Use present tense (_"Add feature ..."_ instead of _"Added feature ..."_)
- Use the imperative mood (_"Fix delay ..."_ instead of _"Fixes delay ..."_)
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the body to explain what and why you have done something, refer to issues and PRs if you want

Check out the [guidelines for commit messages](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53) for more examples and recommendations.

### Branches

- Follow a simple naming scheme that clearly describes the topic you are working on

### Pull Requests

- Use the description field to describe what you are introducing or changing in your branch
- Try to make small PRs that fix/introduce a single item

### Merge Branches

- You cannot push directly to `main`, please create a branch with your changes and open a PR to request code review before merging
- You can use a ["Draft" PR](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) if your work is not done yet
- Verify that all status checks are passing
- Click "Ready to Review" to request merging your branch into `main`
- Since PRs should introduce a single cohesive change to the code, the preferred merge method is [Squash and merge](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-commits)
